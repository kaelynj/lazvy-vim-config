# lazvy-vim-config
My own personal spin on the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) configuration.  Mainly introduces [Neorg]{https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg} and customizes some of the plugins.  I'll update this as I'm able.

Currently this will work with the current most stable release of neovim (0.9.4), though some features of neorg need the nightly build of (0.10.0) in order to work.
